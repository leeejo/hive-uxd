## Principles

* Go prepared
* Ask the right questions, at the right people, at the right time
* Start from broad/general questions, gradually narrowing down to specific ones
* Transcribe verbatim (do not replace interviewee's words with your own interpretation)
* Try your best to make the interview feel like a conversation rather than an interrogation
* You may even share some of your own experiences, but be discerning (it may affect your interviewee's response)

## Output
* Statements (e.g. "The CEO is emphathetic towards the cause")
